# Localization file for EN language.

# This file is loaded into the Translation page in admin. The English file is the base
# for all future translations, meaning all new resources must be put here and they will be
# shown automatically in the Translation page.


# Level 0 is used to separate Admin resources from Site resources.
# Their names are fixed and MUST NOT be changed!
# There are only two resources: 'admin', 'site'


# Level 1 is the category or admin module. It is used in URLs: /admin/translation/{category}
# Examples:
#           'order'
#           'generic'

# Level 2 is the subcategory and is used to group certain resources within a category.
# Examples:
#           order > 'history'
#           order > 'customer'
#           etc
